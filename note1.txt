Linked List (链表)
C++ : std::list
Java : LinkedList
Form , Sheet 表
List ,queue 队列
head ........tail     null
telecommiting, parking lot (见缝插针)
not coufiguous memory location
Scattered
vector : resigable array : contiguous memory consective
priciple of space locality
cache (cash , 缓存)
To speed up procesing , build a cache
Defragmentation 碎片化
adventages : never relocation when growing except for cache
struct name 
{ T data ; Name * next ; }
auto p = new ListName() ;         (heap 堆)
auto i = 40 ;
p ------- data = t ;
p ------- next = null ptr ;
null : undetermined (未定的) 
delete p ;   
node (节点)
class AList
{
      Node * head ;
      append
      msert (data , anchor锚)
      delete();
}

Singlylinked List 
DoulyLinked List
O(1)-------constant time 
For singlylist , the time couplexity for insert before operation in O(N) ------- linear time
For doubly linked list , the time complexity for insert operation in O(1)
std :: list  in a doublylined list ;
Linear structure is used as a buffer.
array fixed
recton dynamic
List very dyramic  (resign frequently)
Stack & queue are special LinkedList
sometimes Stack in mode by rector
but in java;Queue<>q=new LinkedList();
std :: list
java.ulit.LinkedList
